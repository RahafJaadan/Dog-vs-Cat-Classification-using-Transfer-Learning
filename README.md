# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier 
This project aims to develop an AI model that predicts whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The model was built using deep learning, with a focus on improving accuracy and addressing the overfitting issue

## Description 
We trained the model using data from 'Kaggle' with images labeled into categories (cats and dogs). We encountered challenges in balancing the modelâ€™s accuracy between training and testing data. To overcome the overfitting problem, we used Pre-Trained Models such as VGG16 and MobileNetV2. 

## Requirements
* Python
* Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PIL

## Usage
1. Install the requirements:
```
   pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib pillow
```
2. Download training data from Kaggle.
3. Run the model:
  ```
   python train_model.py
```
4. Use the model to classify images:
  ```
   from model import predict
 result = predict("path/to/image.jpg")
```

## Techniques Used 
* **VGG16** and **MobileNetV2** as Pre-Trained Models to improve accuracy.
* Image processing using OpenCV. 
* Data splitting and model performance validation with scikit-learn.
